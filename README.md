# Sepsis Detection
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes tissue damage, organ failure, or death.The goal of this Challenge is the early detection of sepsis using physiological data. Data used in the competition is sourced from ICU patients in three separate hospital systems. 

## Why LSTM:

LSTM networks manage to keep contextual information of inputs by integrating a loop that allows information to flow from one step to the next. Its network helps to build recurrent neural network by learning when to remember and when to forget , through their forget gate weights.

The model has yielded an accuracy of 95%.
